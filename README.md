## My process
First I started off with the mobile first responsive design layout, then I built the top/left hand side portion which is the all purple with the circle number. After I moved on to the summary, and I had noticed that there was a json file, and that you could dynamically import those through there, which was a bit of a challenge since I have only worked with server side API's, and not with a local JSON file it was a bit different, but a good experience none the less. First I made the containers and styled them how I wanted, and then moved into the JavaScript file to create them dynamically. I selected each of the boxes, then created each of the elements and put the selected data[#].element selected to select each of the items to display it on the screen. Then I moved on to the desktop layout. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
-I chose pure.css for this project's framework
-JavaScript
-JSON File
-Dynamically displayed elements

### What I learned
I learned more about fetching, using JSON, and how to use a json file locally, which was something that I haven't done before.
